This is a heavily modified version of ADV-aceCPR - by Belbo. We've altered a lot of the core logic (stripped unneeded for us customisation options), and the behaviour of various effects have on the probabilities. We've renamed classes, and functions to reflect this and to prevent potential clashes. This modification is intended for use within our group only, so your experience may be less than ideal. We highly recommend the ADV-aceCPR mod instead. He did a great amount of work, for us to build upon.

We've also implemented our own defib system, for making casaulties in motorised/mechanised force types more engaging and rewarding for the patients and the medic. This means that the PAK is restricted to use within the facilities (medical tent, and captured facilities count). Defibs can only be used in medical vehicles (for us this is the land rover ambulance, and the fv432 ambulance) - they aren't a full restore, and have requirements in order to do. However, it allows them to get back to the fight for the moment, or be stable enough for CASEVAC for a full heal.

Additionally this mod adds some custom bandage values. These are the ACE bandages, we've just altered values for our internal game play reasons. It is rather erroneously placed here, but let's be honest. Who cares?
